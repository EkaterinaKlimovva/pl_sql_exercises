# Operations polynomials

Create a package that performs operations with polynomials with one variable (multiplication, division, addition/subtraction, simplification (opening brackets, bringing similar terms), exponentiation). Parameters â€“ expressions for polynomials, operation. For a unary operation, an expression for one polynomial and an operation are set, for a binary operation, expressions for two polynomials and an operation are set. Polynomials can be written, for example, in the form: 3x+2x^2-5.
